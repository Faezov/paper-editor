  "abstract": "Francisella tularensis, a highly infectious bacterium, poses a significant public health risk. A key virulence factor of this bacterium, Francisella-like lipoprotein (Flpp3), plays crucial roles in infection and immune evasion. However, the absence of well-defined binding pockets and structural information for Flpp3 has impeded the development of targeted therapeutics. Here we show that we designed high-affinity miniprotein binders that target two distinct sites on Flpp3. We discovered four binders for the first site, with binding affinities ranging between 24-110 nM, and for the second site, we developed variants with sub-nanomolar affinities. The designed miniproteins' structures were confirmed, and the X-ray crystal structure of Flpp3 in complex with a site I binder closely matched the design model. These miniproteins offer valuable research tools for studying Flpp3's role in tularemia and could facilitate the development of new therapeutic candidates.",
  "introduction": "Francisella tularensis, a gram-negative intracellular pathogen, is the causative agent of tularemia, also known as \"rabbit fever\". This highly infectious bacterium can initiate a severe infection with as few as 10-25 bacteria, leading to serious clinical outcomes such as pneumonia, sepsis, and multi-organ failure1. Francisella can evade the immune system and replicate in the cytoplasm of macrophages and dendritic cells2. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classifies F. tularensis as a Tier 1 Select Agent and a Class A bioterrorism agent due to its high risk for weaponization and significant threats from natural outbreaks and bioterrorism3. Despite considerable efforts, there are no approved vaccines for F. tularensis. While tularemia is currently treatable with antibiotics, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of F. tularensis necessitates the development of new medical countermeasures.\n\nWe sought to explore the potential of the outer membrane lipoprotein, Francisella-like lipoprotein (Flpp3), as a novel research tool and therapeutic candidate against tularemia. Flpp3 is a key virulence factor that plays critical roles in the spread and immune evasion of F. tularensis, and mutations in the open reading frame encoding Flpp3 (FTT1416c) have been shown to significantly decrease its virulence4. Flpp3 interferes with host immune responses, notably by extending the lifespan of neutrophils through a TLR2-dependent mechanism that inhibits the apoptosis pathway, promoting tissue destruction and bacterial dissemination9. Previous studies have identified Flpp3 as a potential plasminogen-binding candidate, contributing to extracellular matrix degradation and potential systemic dissemination10. However, the specific role of Flpp3 in this process remains to be experimentally confirmed. Despite some knowledge about Flpp3's functions, the full scope of its cellular localization, interactions with other proteins, and contributions to virulence remain unclear.\n\nThe structure of Flpp3 has been characterized by X-ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy8. This provides opportunities for the structure-guided design of Flpp3 inhibitors. However, there are several challenges to targeting Flpp3 using rational approaches. No structurally-characterized binding partners of Flpp3 have been identified, and no deep pockets on the surface of Flpp3 are available for targeting with small molecules. The structural flexibility of Flpp3 also presents additional challenges for structure-guided design efforts. Despite these challenges, we reasoned that recent advances in physics-based and deep-learning (DL)-based design methods could enable the design of new Flpp3 binders. We leveraged these computational methods to generate miniprotein binders targeting Flpp3, identifying multiple high-affinity binders with low nanomolar to picomolar binding affinities against two different sites of Flpp3. This approach provides avenues for further exploring the cellular localization of Flpp3, its functional roles in infection, and the development of new therapeutic interventions against tularemia.",
  "results": "Research Goal and Methodology\n\nThe goal of this research was to design, select, and optimize miniprotein binders against Flpp3, a virulence factor, using a combination of physics-based and deep learning (DL) methods. The structure of Flpp3's soluble domain was used as a starting point for design calculations. Miniprotein binders were designed against both faces of the Flpp3 structure, referred to as the 'alpha site' and 'beta site'. \n\nComputational Design of Flpp3 Binders\n\nA three-step computational pipeline was used to design miniprotein binders against the selected sites. The Rosetta RifDock approach was used to select miniprotein backbones with a high likelihood of making favorable interactions with Flpp3. A scaffold library of 43,724 pre-enumerated miniproteins was used for this purpose. The docking results were refined using RIFDock and a hierarchical search approach. ProteinMPNN, a DL-based tool, was used to redesign the amino acid sequence of the selected minibinder backbones. All designed minibinders were filtered based on the Rosetta metrics for interface quality and by re-predicting the structures of designed complexes using AlphaFold2. \n\nYeast Display Screening and Biochemical Characterization\n\nThe designed minibinders were screened for binding to Flpp3 using yeast surface display and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. After sequencing the binding cells from different sorts, four promising binders for the alpha site and one additional binder for the beta site were identified. \n\nOptimization of the Beta Site Binders\n\nThe beta site binder was further optimized using site saturation mutagenesis. A pooled library of 1,046 BSD1 variants was generated and screened for binding to Flpp3. Sequencing data from the SSM library sorting suggested nine amino acid positions where mutations could potentially improve binding affinity. \n\nStructural Characterization by Circular Dichroism\n\nCircular dichroism was used to determine the thermal stability and provide low-resolution structural information for the designed minibinders. Both alpha site and beta site binders were found to adopt the designed topology and refold back to the designed fold even after heating up to 95\u2103 and cooling back. \n\nStructure Determination of Flpp3-Minibinder Complex by X-ray Crystallography\n\nThe X-ray crystal structure of the best alpha site binder, ASD1, in complex with Flpp3 was solved. The structure revealed that ASD1 binds Flpp3 through the designed interface, showing a close agreement between the experimental structure and the design model. \n\nCharacterization of Flpp3 Surface Accessibility\n\nThe ability of designed minibinders to label Flpp3 on the surface of intact Francisella was assessed using flow cytometry. No significant change in cell labeling between WT and \u0394Flpp3 deletion strains was observed. \n\nConclusion\n\nThe research successfully designed multiple miniprotein binders against two different sites of Flpp3. The best binder for the alpha site displayed a KD of 24 nM, while the best binder for the beta site had a dissociation constant of 580 picomolar. The designed binders can be used to explore the molecular mechanisms employed by F. tularensis during infection and immune evasion, and guide the development of small molecules and peptides with drug-like properties. Future research will focus on optimizing the selected binders and evaluating their therapeutic potential in preclinical studies."
