  "abstract": "Francisella tularensis is a highly infectious bacterium with potential for bioterrorism use. A key virulence factor in this bacterium, Francisella-like lipoprotein (Flpp3), is crucial for infection and immune evasion, making it an attractive target for therapy. However, the absence of well-defined binding pockets and structural information for Flpp3 has impeded the development of targeted treatments. Here we show that we designed high-affinity miniprotein binders targeting two distinct sites on Flpp3 using physics-based and deep-learning methods. We discovered four binders for one site with binding affinities between 24-110 nM, and for the second site, we developed variants with sub-nanomolar affinities. The structural integrity of the designed miniprotein was confirmed by circular dichroism, and the X-ray crystal structure of Flpp3 in complex with a binder closely matched the design model. These findings offer valuable tools for studying Flpp3's role in tularemia and could pave the way for new therapeutic candidates.",
  "introduction": "Francisella tularensis, the causative agent of tularemia, is a highly infectious gram-negative intracellular pathogen. This bacterium can initiate a severe infection with as few as 10-25 bacteria, leading to serious clinical outcomes such as pneumonia, sepsis, and multi-organ failure. Francisella employs multiple immune evasion strategies, enabling it to escape phagosomes and replicate in the cytoplasm of macrophages and dendritic cells. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classifies F. tularensis as a Tier 1 Select Agent and a Class A bioterrorism agent due to its high risk for weaponization and significant threats from natural outbreaks and bioterrorism. Despite considerable efforts, no approved vaccines are available for F. tularensis. While tularemia is currently treatable with antibiotics, the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains necessitates the development of new medical countermeasures.\n\nThe outer membrane lipoprotein, Francisella-like lipoprotein (Flpp3), is a key virulence factor that plays critical roles in the spread and immune evasion of F. tularensis. Mutations in the open reading frame encoding Flpp3 have been shown to significantly decrease its virulence. Flpp3 interferes with host immune responses, notably by extending the lifespan of neutrophils through a TLR2-dependent mechanism that inhibits the apoptosis pathway, promoting tissue destruction and bacterial dissemination. Previous studies have identified several outer membrane lipoproteins, including Flpp3, as potential plasminogen-binding candidates. However, the specific role of Flpp3 in this process remains unconfirmed. Despite its well-studied functions, the full scope of Flpp3's cellular localization, interactions with other proteins, and contributions to virulence remain unclear. We reasoned that Flpp3, being uniquely found in Francisella, presents an attractive target for therapeutic development.\n\nThe structure of Flpp3 has been characterized by X-ray Free-Electron Laser (XFEL) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, providing a basis for the structure-guided design of Flpp3 inhibitors. However, several challenges exist in targeting Flpp3 using rational approaches. No structurally-characterized binding partners of Flpp3 have been identified, and no deep pockets on the surface of Flpp3 are available for targeting with small molecules. Additionally, the structural flexibility of Flpp3 presents further challenges for structure-guided design efforts. Despite these challenges, we sought to leverage recent advances in physics-based and deep-learning (DL)-based design methods to design new Flpp3 binders. We utilized de novo computational design methods to generate miniprotein binders targeting Flpp3, identifying multiple high-affinity binders with low nanomolar to picomolar binding affinities against two different sites of Flpp3. This approach provides avenues for further exploring the cellular localization of Flpp3, its functional roles in infection, and the development of new therapeutic interventions against tularemia.",
  "results": "Research Goal and Methodology\n\nThe research aimed to design and optimize miniprotein binders against Flpp3, a virulence factor, using physics-based and deep learning-based methods. The structure of Flpp3's soluble domain was used to initiate design calculations. Two sites on Flpp3 were selected for minibinder design: the 'alpha site' and the 'beta site'. A three-step computational pipeline was used to design the miniprotein binders.\n\nDesign and Selection of Miniprotein Binders\n\nThe Rosetta RifDock approach was used to select miniprotein backbones from a pre-enumerated library. The global shape complementarity docking was performed using PatchDock. The docking results were refined using RIFDock and a hierarchical search approach. 500,000 docked conformations were generated and selected for further sequence design and in silico evaluation. The ProteinMPNN tool was used to redesign the amino acid sequence of the selected minibinder backbones. All designed minibinders were filtered based on the Rosetta metrics for interface quality and by re-predicting the structures of designed complexes using AlphaFold2. 15,000 alpha site design models and 8,817 beta site design models were selected for experimental screening and characterization.\n\nYeast Display Screening and Biochemical Characterization\n\nThe selected miniproteins were screened for binding to Flpp3 using yeast surface display and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Four promising binders for the alpha site and one for the beta site were identified. The design models for all five binders have a three-helix topology with two helices making extensive contacts with the Flpp3 surface. The binding affinities of the miniproteins to Flpp3 were confirmed using Bio-layer interferometry.\n\nOptimization of Beta Site Binders\n\nThe affinity of the beta site binder was improved using site saturation mutagenesis. A pooled library of 1,046 BSD1 variants was generated and screened for binding to Flpp3. The SSM-optimized library showed a clear binding signal even during sorting runs with 1 nM of monomeric Flpp3. Twelve single-mutation variants, seven double-mutation variants, and five triple-mutation variants of BSD1 were selected for further characterization. 18 out of the 22 tested variants showed better KD than the native binder.\n\nStructural Characterization and Confirmation of Binding Mode\n\nThe thermal stability and structural information of the designed minibinders were determined using circular dichroism. The X-ray crystal structure of the best alpha site binder, ASD1, in a complex with Flpp3 was solved, confirming that ASD1 binds Flpp3 through the designed interface.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe research successfully designed and validated multiple miniprotein binders against two different sites of Flpp3. The computational approach overcame several challenges in targeting Flpp3 and highlighted the potential for computational approaches to custom-design miniproteins with shapes and sizes that complement and bind bacterial virulence factors with very high affinity. The designed binders offer a means to precisely perturb Flpp3's interactions with other proteins and explore the molecular mechanisms employed by F. tularensis during infection and immune evasion. Future research will focus on optimizing the selected binders and evaluating their therapeutic potential in preclinical studies."
